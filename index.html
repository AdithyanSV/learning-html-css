    <p>A V engine, also known as a Vee engine, is a type of internal combustion engine with cylinders arranged in a V shape relative to each other. The two banks of cylinders are angled towards each other, with the crankshaft located at the intersection of the two banks. Each bank is connected to its own set of intake and exhaust manifolds, which are responsible for bringing air and fuel into the cylinders and removing the exhaust gases, respectively. The firing order of a V engine varies depending on the number of cylinders and the angle between the cylinder banks. Despite being more complex than other engine configurations due to its two cylinder banks, the V engine remains a popular choice for high-performance vehicles and sports cars due to its compact size and high power output.</p>
    <p>A boxer engine, also known as a horizontally opposed engine, is a type of internal combustion engine where the cylinders are arranged in two banks, opposite each other, and lying flat. The cylinders are aligned in a horizontal position, and each piston is positioned to face away from the other. This creates a characteristic "boxer" or "flat" layout, hence the name. The pistons in a boxer engine move in opposite directions, canceling out the primary forces that create vibration in other engine configurations. This results in a smoother operation and a lower center of gravity, which improves stability and handling. Boxer engines are commonly used in high-performance vehicles and sports cars due to their low profile, smooth operation, and improved balance. Despite being more complex to manufacture than other engine configurations, the boxer engine remains a popular choice for automotive enthusiasts who appreciate its unique design and performance advantages.</p>
    <p>A rotary engine, also known as a Wankel engine, is a type of internal combustion engine where the rotors rotate in a circular motion within a housing, instead of reciprocating pistons. The engine has a triangular rotor that rotates within an oval-shaped housing. As the rotor turns, it creates a seal between itself and the housing, forming three different chambers within the engine. The fuel and air mixture enters the first chamber, where it is compressed by the rotor. As the rotor continues to turn, the compressed mixture enters the second chamber, where it is ignited by a spark plug. The third chamber acts as an exhaust port, allowing the burnt gases to be expelled from the engine. This design allows for a high power-to-weight ratio, as the engine has fewer moving parts and can operate at high RPMs. Rotary engines are commonly used in high-performance sports cars and aircraft due to their compact size, high power output, and smooth operation. Despite their advantages, rotary engines are more complex to manufacture and maintain than other engine configurations, which has limited their widespread use in mainstream vehicles.</p>
